## 1. Spring cloud : Tracing service with zipkinm server (Docker)
### Project ref: *N/A*
- **<ins>Purpose / Feature</ins>**
  - Zipkin‚Å† is a distributed tracing system. 
  - It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in service architectures.
  - Features include both the collection and lookup of this data.
  - If you have a trace ID in a log file, you can jump directly to it. Otherwise, you can query based on attributes such as service, operation name, tags and duration. Some interesting data will be summarized for you, such as the percentage of time spent in a service, and whether or not operations failed.
  - Each of the `microservice` send the tracing info to the zipkin tracing server. Zipkin store the information in database and provides UI.
  - Dependencies:
      - Micrometer:  
        - Bridges the Micrometer Observation API to OpenTelemetry.
        - Hamdles logs, traces & matrics.
      - OpenTelemetry: 
        - Reports traces to Zipkin.
        - Hamdles logs, traces & matrics.
      - OpenZipkin brave: 
- **<ins>Steps</ins>**
  - ***Project Setup:*** Docker must be installed and running.
  - ***Step-1:*** Pull zepkin image from docker hub and create container.
    - ***docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin***
  - ***Step-2:*** Now we can access `Zipkin` locally on `http://localhost:9411/zipkin/`.

> Note: We can also create spring boot app with zepkin serevr.

## 2. Spring cloud: Zipkin client
### Project ref: *d2-zipkin-currency-exchange-service*
- **<ins>Purpose / Feature</ins>**
  - Centralized tracing using logs, matrices and/or graphs.
- **<ins>Steps</ins>**
  - ***Project Setup:*** An existing microservice / create one.
  - ***Step-1:*** pom.xml: Add micrometer, micrometer tracing bridge & opentelemetry dependencies.
    - Micrometer: Assigns ID to request, which remains same when other microservices are called in the same request. 
      - E.g. Req. 1: currency-conversion-service --> currency-exchange-service 
  - ***Step-2:*** Add sampling configuration to define how much percentage of request will be sampled.
    - `management.tracing.sampling.probability=1.0 # 1.0 -> 100%,  #SB3 `
    - `logging.pattern.level=%5p [${spring.application.name:},%X{traceId:-},%X{spanId:-}] #SB3`
- **<ins>Maven / External dependency</ins>**
  - Required dependency.
